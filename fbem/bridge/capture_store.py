"""Persist crawler captures of genuine native Facebook upload requests.

The crawler (injected main-world script on facebook.com) snapshots real upload
requests when the user manually posts a Reel, and relays each through the
extension to ``POST /api/ext/capture``. Each capture is a dict shaped like:

    { kind: "rupload" | "graphql", url, method, headers, body, friendlyName? }

We append every capture to ``captures/<unix-ts>-<kind>.json`` (full audit trail)
and fold the latest of each kind into ``captures/template.json``:

    { "rupload": {...}, "graphql": {...}, "updatedAt": <unix-ts> }

The replay (``/post-reel``) loads ``template.json`` and substitutes fresh
volatile tokens. When FB rotates its payload shape, the user re-captures; no
code change needed (self-healing by design).
